    \brief The PackageSource class specifies a single package source.

    An package source represents a link to an repository that contains packages applicable by
    the installer or package maintenance application. This structure describes a single package
    source in terms of url and priority. While different repositories can host the same packages,
    packages coming from a higher priority source take precedence over lower priority packages
    during applicable package computation.
