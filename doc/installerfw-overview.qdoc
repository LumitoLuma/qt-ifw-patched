    \title Overview of Qt Installer Framework

    The Qt Installer Framework provides a set of tools and utilities to
    create installers once, and deploy them across all the supported desktop
    Qt platforms without rewriting the source code. The installers will have
    the native look and feel of the platform on which they run: Linux,
    Microsoft Windows, and macOS.

    The Qt Installer Framework tools generate installers with a set of pages
    that guide the users during the installation, update, or uninstall
    process. You supply the installable content and specify information about
    it, such as the name of the product and the installer and the text for the
    license agreement.

    You can customize the installers by adding widgets to the predefined pages
    or by adding whole pages to offer users more options. You can
    create scripts to add operations to the installer.

    \section1 Choosing Installer Type

    You can offer end users an \e offline or \e online installer, or
    both, depending on your use cases.

    Both installers install a \e {\MT}, which allows you to later
    add, update, and remove components. Offline installers contain all the
    installable components and do not require network connections during the
    installation. Online installers only install the \MT that then
    downloads and installs components from an online repository on a web server.
    Therefore, the size of an online installer binary is smaller and its
    download time is shorter than that of an offline installer binary. The total
    time spent downloading and running an online installer might also be shorter
    than downloading and running an offline installer if the end users do not
    install all the available components.

    End users can use the \MT to install more components from
    the server after the initial installation, as well as to receive automatic
    updates to content as soon as the updates are available on the server.
    However, this works for an offline installation only if you specify a
    repository address in the offline installer configuration or if end users
    specify the repository address themselves in the \MT settings.

    Create an offline installer to enable users to directly download the
    installation package on a media for installation on a computer later. You
    can also distribute the installation package on a CD-ROM or USB stick, for
    example.

    Create an online installer to enable users to always install the latest
    versions of the content binaries.

    \section1 Promoting Updates

    Make online repositories available to promote updates to end users who
    install your product. The easiest way to offer an update is to recreate
    the repository and upload it to the web server. For large repositories, you
    can update only the changed components.

    \section1 Providing Content for Installers

    You can enable other content providers to add components to the installer
    as add-on components. The component providers must set up repositories that
    contain the installable components and deliver the URL that points to the
    repositories to end users. End users must then configure the URL in the
    installer. The add-on components are visible in the package manager.
